# Visual and Spatial Gradient Lab Website

This codebase belongs to the visual and spatial gradient lab in Texas A&M University, College Station.

## Running a local version of the codebase
If you simple open the files in a browser, you will run into the issue of data not loading. This is because the browser is not allowed by default to access all the files on your computer as a security precaution. **I recommend you keep it that way if you don't know what you're doing.**

So to properly run the site. You'll need to run a live server in the given folder.
**I prefer using the VSCode extension [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).**
If you are not using VS Code, then I recommend using the deafult server in python. By running the following commands in your terminal or powershell or cmd.

```
    cd {PATH_TO_THE_SITE_FOLDER}/Lab
    python -m http.server
```

After running this you'll have the codebase running on [localhost:8000](localhost:8000) by default. For more details see, [https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/http.server.html](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/http.server.html).
